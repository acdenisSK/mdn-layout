# mdn-layout

This is a recreation of [the MDN Test Your Skills: Fundamental layout comprehension][test] to improve my CSS skills.

It is a blind recreation. That is to say, apart from the paragraphs that I copied straight from the example's source,
I avoided looking at the source as much as possible, relying only on myself.
